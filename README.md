# `@hchiam/deps`

## Usage

```bash
npm -g install @hchiam/deps
```

Now you can use it in any folder with this command:

```bash
deps
```

## Further development

Commands I found useful while creating this CLI tool from scratch:

- `npm link`
- `rm /Users/howard/.nvm/versions/node/v10.13.0/bin/deps`
- `npm publish --access public`
